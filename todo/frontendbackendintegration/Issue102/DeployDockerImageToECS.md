letâ€™s go **step by step** to push your updated Docker image and deploy it to ECS. Iâ€™ll assume you are using **Amazon ECR** (Elastic Container Registry) and an ECS service.

---

## **Step 1 â€” Authenticate Docker to ECR**

Find your ECR repository URI (example: `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend`) and run:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

> Replace the account ID, region, and repo name with your actual values.

---

## **Step 2 â€” Tag your local image for ECR**

If your local image is `tts-backend:latest` and your ECR repo is `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend`:

```bash
docker tag tts-backend:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend:latest
```

---

## **Step 3 â€” Push the image to ECR**

```bash
docker push 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend:latest
```

You should see progress as layers upload. After it finishes, your image is in ECR.

---

## **Step 4 â€” Update ECS service to use the new image**

1. Go to **ECS â†’ Clusters â†’ YourCluster â†’ Services â†’ YourService**.
2. Click **Update**.
3. In **Task Definition**, choose **Create new revision** (or use an existing revision and update image URI):

   * If creating a new revision, update the container image to:

     ```
     123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend:latest
     ```
4. Keep other settings the same.
5. Click **Update Service** â†’ ECS will deploy the new task(s) with your updated image.

---

## **Step 5 â€” Verify deployment**

```bash
curl -i http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
```

* If 200 OK â†’ deployment successful.
* If 500 â†’ still hitting S3 permissions issue.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** ECS tasks pull images from ECR automatically. Make sure the ECS **task role / execution role** has permission to pull images from ECR (usually done with `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy`).

---

Next step: We can write you **exact commands to update ECS entirely from the CLI** without touching the console, so you can push a new image and deploy in one flow.
