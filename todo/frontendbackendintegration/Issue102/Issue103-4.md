Perfect — this confirms a few things:

1. **boto3 is installed in your virtual environment** (`venv`) for the backend. ✅
2. Before activating the venv, `pip show boto3` could not find it — that’s normal. Pylance was probably using the wrong interpreter (the global Python instead of your venv).
3. In your ECS container, **boto3 must also be installed** via `requirements.txt` or the Docker image. Otherwise, the container would throw `ModuleNotFoundError`.

### What to do locally so Pylance stops complaining

* Make sure VSCode / Pylance is using the **Python interpreter from your `venv`**:

1. Open Command Palette → `Python: Select Interpreter`.
2. Choose:

   ```
   /Users/ilakkuvaselvimanoharan/tts-next-fast-aws/backend/venv/bin/python
   ```
3. Reload VSCode. The `Import "boto3"` warning should disappear.

### Next — ECS deployment check

Even though boto3 exists locally, your deployed backend in ECS may fail if boto3 isn’t installed in the Docker image.

**Steps to confirm/fix:**

1. Open your `backend/requirements.txt` and make sure it includes:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
boto3
...
```

2. Rebuild Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t tts-backend:latest .
```

3. Push the new image to your repository and update ECS service to use it.

⚡ **Important:** Your `/health` 500 error is **not because boto3 is missing**, it’s the **S3 403**. Installing boto3 locally just fixes your IDE warning.

Next, we need to **fix the S3 permissions** so the `/health` route passes.

Do you want me to guide you step by step to **update the ECS task IAM role** for S3 access?
