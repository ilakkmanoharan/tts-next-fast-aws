ECS deployment check
Even though boto3 exists locally, your deployed backend in ECS may fail if boto3 isn’t installed in the Docker image.
Steps to confirm/fix:

Open your backend/requirements.txt and make sure it includes:
fastapi
uvicorn
boto3
...
Rebuild Docker image:
docker build -t tts-backend:latest .
Push the new image to your repository and update ECS service to use it.
⚡ Important: Your /health 500 error is not because boto3 is missing, it’s the S3 403. Installing boto3 locally just fixes your IDE warning.


Next Step:: we need to fix the S3 permissions so the /health route passes.

Do you want me to guide you step by step to update the ECS task IAM role for S3 access?

Perfect — running this command will give you the full info about your ECR repository, including the **repository URI** you need.

The expected output looks like this:

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "repositoryArn": "arn:aws:ecr:us-east-1:123456789012:repository/tts-backend",
            "registryId": "123456789012",
            "repositoryName": "tts-backend",
            "repositoryUri": "123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend",
            "createdAt": "2025-09-20T22:00:00Z",
            "imageTagMutability": "MUTABLE",
            "imageScanningConfiguration": {"scanOnPush": false}
        }
    ]
}
```

---

### ✅ Key part you need

* **repositoryUri**:

```
123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend
```

This is what Docker will use to **tag and push** your image.

---

Next steps after this:

1. Authenticate Docker to ECR with this URI.
2. Tag your local image with this URI.
3. Push the image.
4. Update ECS service to use the new image.

I can give you the **exact commands for all four steps** so you can do it in one go.

Do you want me to do that?

Perfect — here’s exactly how to authenticate Docker to your ECR repository. This lets Docker push and pull images securely.

---

### **Step 1 — Use AWS CLI to get a login token**

Run:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

**Replace** `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` with your **repository URI without the repository name**.

* The part before the last slash is enough:

```
<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

---

### **Step 2 — Verify login succeeded**

You should see:

```
Login Succeeded
```

If you see `Login Succeeded`, Docker is now authenticated with AWS ECR and can push/pull images.

---

### ✅ Notes

* This command works for **ECR in the same region as your AWS CLI default** (`us-east-1` here).
* If you have multiple AWS profiles, you can specify:

```bash
aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 --profile myprofile | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

---

After this, the next steps are:

1. Tag your local image with the ECR repository URI.
2. Push the image to ECR.
3. Update ECS service to use the new image.

I can give you the **full sequence of commands from tagging → pushing → ECS update** so it’s ready to run.

Do you want me to do that?

____________________________

Perfect — tagging your local Docker image is simple. Here’s exactly how:

---

### **Step 1 — Check your local image**

List your local images to see the name and tag:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see something like:

```
REPOSITORY          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
tts-backend         latest    abc123def456   2 hours ago   500MB
```

---

### **Step 2 — Tag the image for ECR**

Docker images must be tagged with the **full ECR repository URI** before pushing.

Assume your local image is `tts-backend:latest` and your ECR URI is:

```
123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend
```

Run:

```bash
docker tag tts-backend:latest 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend:latest
```

* Left side = local image name
* Right side = ECR URI + desired tag (`latest` here)

---

### **Step 3 — Verify the tag**

```bash
docker images
```

You should now see both:

```
REPOSITORY                                             TAG       IMAGE ID
tts-backend                                            latest    abc123def456
123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-backend   latest    abc123def456
```

✅ Both point to the same image — you’re ready to push to ECR.

---

Next step: **push the tagged image to ECR**.

Do you want me to give the exact command for that?
