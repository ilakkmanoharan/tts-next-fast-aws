{"status":"fail","dependency":"s3","error":"An error occurred (403) when calling the HeadBucket operation: Forbidden"}%     




Got it ✅ — this is very clear now.

Your `/health` endpoint is not a simple “I’m alive” check. It’s also testing **S3 access**, and that check is failing:

```
{"status":"fail","dependency":"s3","error":"An error occurred (403) when calling the HeadBucket operation: Forbidden"}
```

That means:

* FastAPI is running fine.
* The `/health` route tries to `HeadBucket` (check if an S3 bucket exists).
* The IAM role / credentials your ECS task is using **don’t have permission** to access that bucket (or you’re pointing to the wrong bucket name).

---

## Step 1 — confirm which bucket is being checked

Look in your `/health` code — likely something like:

```python
#s3 = boto3.client("s3")
s3 = get_s3_client()
s3.head_bucket(Bucket=settings.S3_BUCKET_NAME)
```

Check what `settings.S3_BUCKET_NAME` is set to in ECS.

---

## Step 2 — confirm IAM permissions

The ECS task execution role or task role must include a policy like:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:HeadBucket",
    "s3:GetObject",
    "s3:PutObject"
  ],
  "Resource": [
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
  ]
}
```

Go to **IAM → Roles → (ECS Task Role)** and check if this policy is attached.
If not, attach it or update the policy.

---

## Step 3 — confirm credentials in the container

SSH / exec into the ECS task container and run:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name
```

If you get `AccessDenied`, the task role isn’t set up properly. If it lists objects, then the bucket name might be wrong.

---

## Step 4 — quick workaround

If you don’t actually need S3 in the `/health` endpoint, you can make `/health` a lightweight **liveness probe**:

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

…and create a separate `/ready` endpoint for S3, DB, etc. That way ALB health checks won’t fail just because S3 is misconfigured.

---

⚡ Next action for you:

* Do you want me to give you the **exact IAM policy JSON** you can attach to your ECS task role so that the S3 check passes?
