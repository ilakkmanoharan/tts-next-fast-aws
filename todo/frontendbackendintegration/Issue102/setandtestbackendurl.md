Your backend load balancer (ALB) URL from ECS. Right now you have it in your `.env` file as

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

But your shell doesn’t know it yet — that’s why `$BACKEND_URL` was empty when you ran `curl`.

---

## Step 1 — export it for this shell

```bash
export BACKEND_URL="http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com"
```

---

## Step 2 — test the health endpoint

```bash
curl -i -sS -X GET "$BACKEND_URL/health" -H "Accept: application/json" -v
```

You should now get one of these:

* ✅ `200 OK` with `{"status":"ok"}` → your backend is healthy.
* ❌ `500 Internal Server Error` → the FastAPI app is running but failing inside `/health`.
* ❌ `404 Not Found` → maybe your route isn’t exactly `/health` (could be `/api/health` or something else).
* ❌ `502/504` → ALB can’t talk to your ECS task (networking/security group issue).

---

## Step 3 — if you still see `500`

We’ll need to look at the **backend logs in CloudWatch** for the ECS service. That will show the Python traceback for why `/health` is failing.

👉 Do you want me to give you the **exact AWS CLI commands** to pull your ECS task logs from CloudWatch so we can see the error?
