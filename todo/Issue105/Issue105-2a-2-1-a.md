1. Identify your ECS Task Role
Run this command to see which IAM role your ECS task is using:
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition backend
Look for the field:
"taskRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<your-task-role>"
That‚Äôs the IAM role we need to check.

An error occurred (ClientException) when calling the DescribeTaskDefinition operation: Unable to describe task definition.

Got it üëç ‚Äî that error means AWS can‚Äôt find a task definition named just `backend`.
When you deployed with Copilot, it created a **full ECS task definition ARN** with version numbers (e.g. `backend:1`, `backend:12`, etc.), not just `backend`.

Let‚Äôs fix this step by step:

---

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Use Copilot to find the exact task definition

Run:

```bash
copilot svc show --name backend
```

Scroll down ‚Äî in the **Service Discovery / Tasks** section it should list the latest task definition name (like `tts-next-fast-aws-backend:12`).

---

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Ask ECS for all task definitions and filter

Run:

```bash
aws ecs list-task-definitions --family-prefix backend
```

This will return something like:

```
[
  "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:task-definition/backend:12",
  "arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:123456789012:task-definition/backend:11",
  ...
]
```

Pick the **latest one** (highest number).

---

### ‚úÖ Option 3: Describe the latest task definition

Once you know the right name, run:

```bash
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition backend:12
```

(or whichever version you saw in step 2).
Then look for:

```json
"taskRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<role-name>"
```

That‚Äôs the IAM role we need to check for S3 permissions.

---

üëâ Do you want to try **Option 1 (`copilot svc show`)** first and paste me the section that shows the **task definition**? That will let me pull out the exact role name for you.
