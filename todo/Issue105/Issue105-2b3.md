Ah ‚Äî that explains it. üëç If you don‚Äôt have a `copilot/backend/manifest.yml`, then your service was probably created some time ago and Copilot didn‚Äôt generate a full service manifest locally, or it was deleted.

You **need a service manifest** to define environment variables like `AWS_S3_BUCKET`.

### üîπ Options

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate a new manifest for the existing service

From your project root:

```bash
copilot svc init --name backend --svc-type "Load Balanced Web Service" --dockerfile ./backend/Dockerfile
```

* **Important:** Don‚Äôt worry, it won‚Äôt recreate the service; it will just generate `copilot/backend/manifest.yml`.
* After generating, add:

```yaml
variables:
  AWS_S3_BUCKET: ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
```

Then redeploy:

```bash
copilot svc deploy --name backend --env dev
```

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quick alternative: use Copilot CLI to set env var without manifest

Copilot supports setting variables directly on the service:

```bash
copilot svc env-vars backend --env dev
```

* It will prompt you to add a new variable:

```
Variable name: AWS_S3_BUCKET
Value: ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
```

* Then redeploy automatically.
* This avoids manually creating a manifest.

---

‚úÖ After either method, run:

```bash
copilot svc show --name backend
```

You should now see:

```
AWS_S3_BUCKET   backend   dev   ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
```

---

I can give you a **step-by-step one-liner Copilot CLI sequence** that sets the bucket env var and redeploys the service immediately so you don‚Äôt have to touch manifests at all. Do you want me to do that?
