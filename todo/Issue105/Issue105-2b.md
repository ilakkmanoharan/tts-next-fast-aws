Ah â€” thanks for pasting the **Task Definition JSON view**. âœ…

I see the problem: your **ECS Task Definition** has **no `AWS_S3_BUCKET` env var**. That means in your code:

```python
BUCKET = os.getenv("AWS_S3_BUCKET", "my-bucket")
```

â€¦it is falling back to `"my-bucket"` (which doesnâ€™t exist) â†’ hence the `/health` check fails with **AccessDenied**.

---

### ðŸ”§ Fix Options

Since youâ€™re using **AWS Copilot**, you should set this env var at the service level. That way, Copilot injects it into the Task Definition automatically.

---

#### Option 1: Via Copilot CLI

Run this from your `backend/` directory:

```bash
copilot svc deploy \
  --name backend \
  --env dev \
  --resource-tags AWS_S3_BUCKET=ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
```

Or cleaner, run:

```bash
copilot svc env-vars backend -n dev
```

and then add:

```bash
AWS_S3_BUCKET=ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
```

---

#### Option 2: Via `manifest.yml`

Open `copilot/backend/manifest.yml`, under `variables:`, add:

```yaml
variables:
  AWS_S3_BUCKET: ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
```

Then redeploy:

```bash
copilot svc deploy --name backend --env dev
```

---

#### Option 3: Manually (not recommended)

You could go into the **ECS Console â†’ Task Definition â†’ Edit JSON** and add the env var manually under `environment`, but Copilot will overwrite it on next deploy. Safer to configure through Copilot.

---

### âœ… What Happens After Fix

* Your task will now get the correct bucket name injected.
* `/health` will run:

  ```python
  s3.head_bucket(Bucket="ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31")
  ```

  with the ECS task roleâ€™s IAM permissions.
* No more **AccessDenied** if the role policy allows S3 access.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to draft the **exact IAM policy JSON** you should attach to your Copilot-generated ECS task role so it can access `ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31` without errors?
