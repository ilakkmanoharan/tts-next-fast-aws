Recommended follow-up action:

  Nice üöÄ ‚Äî this deploy log shows a **successful build + push to ECR + Copilot stack update**.

Key parts:

* ‚úÖ Image built and pushed to ECR:

  ```
  681916125840.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/tts-next-fast-aws/backend:latest
  ```
* ‚úÖ Copilot updated ECS service `backend` (rev 7 now running).
* ‚úÖ Task definition + IAM roles recreated.
* ‚úÖ Service is live behind the ALB:

  ```
  http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
  ```

---

### üîç What to verify now

1. Go to **ECS ‚Üí Task Definitions ‚Üí latest revision** and check under *Environment variables*. You should now see:

   ```
   AWS_S3_BUCKET = ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
   ```

   along with the `COPILOT_*` vars.

2. Hit the health endpoint again:

   ```bash
   curl -i http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
   ```

   * If **S3 IAM role** is fixed ‚Üí `"s3":"ok"`.
   * If **Polly still fails** ‚Üí you‚Äôll see the `MaxResults` error until you patch the code.

---

### üõ† Next Fix: Polly Error

From your earlier log:

```
"polly":"fail (Parameter validation failed: Unknown parameter in input: \"MaxResults\")"
```

That means in your backend code you have something like:

```python
polly.describe_voices(MaxResults=10)
```

But the **valid params** are only:

* `Engine`
* `LanguageCode`
* `IncludeAdditionalLanguageCodes`
* `NextToken`

‚úÖ Fix snippet:

```python
# Wrong
polly.describe_voices(MaxResults=10)

# Right
polly.describe_voices(LanguageCode="en-US")
```

---

üëâ Do you want me to help you **find & patch the exact line in your backend code** where `MaxResults` is being passed to Polly?


-------------------

Yes üëç you don‚Äôt need to click through the ECS console ‚Äî you can check env vars from the CLI.

---

### üîπ Option 1: Copilot CLI (preferred)

Copilot tracks env vars for each service. Run:

```bash
copilot svc show --name backend --env dev
```

Scroll down to the **Environment Variables** section ‚Üí you should see:

```
AWS_S3_BUCKET = ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME = tts-next-fast-aws
...
```

---

### üîπ Option 2: AWS CLI

You can inspect the active task definition with:

```bash
aws ecs describe-task-definition \
  --task-definition tts-next-fast-aws-dev-backend \
  --query "taskDefinition.containerDefinitions[0].environment"
```

That will output something like:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "AWS_S3_BUCKET",
    "value": "ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31"
  },
  {
    "name": "COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME",
    "value": "tts-next-fast-aws"
  }
  ...
]
```

---

üëâ Do you want me to give you a **ready-to-run Copilot one-liner** that will just print out the `AWS_S3_BUCKET` value for your `backend` service in `dev`?

Ahh right ‚Äî my bad üëÄ. `copilot svc show` does **not** take `--env`. It shows service info across all envs.

Here‚Äôs the correct way:

---

### ‚úÖ Copilot Command

```bash
copilot svc show --name backend
```

This will output something like:

```
About

  Application       tts-next-fast-aws
  Name              backend
  Type              Load Balanced Web Service

Variables

  Name                      Environment  Value

  AWS_S3_BUCKET             dev          ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
  COPILOT_APPLICATION_NAME  all          tts-next-fast-aws
  COPILOT_ENVIRONMENT_NAME  all          dev
  ...
```

---

### ‚úÖ Alternative: AWS CLI

If you want *just the env vars* from the latest ECS task definition:

```bash
aws ecs describe-task-definition \
  --task-definition $(aws ecs describe-services \
    --cluster tts-next-fast-aws-dev \
    --services backend \
    --query "services[0].taskDefinition" \
    --output text) \
  --query "taskDefinition.containerDefinitions[0].environment"
```

That will print the env vars as JSON.

---

üëâ Do you want me to simplify this into a **tiny script** that just prints the value of `AWS_S3_BUCKET` so you don‚Äôt have to parse JSON manually?
