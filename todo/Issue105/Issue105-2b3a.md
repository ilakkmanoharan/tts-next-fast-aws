✘ cannot deploy a service to an undeployed environment. Please run "copilot env deploy --name dev" to deploy the environment first

Ah — that makes sense. Copilot is saying your **`dev` environment has not been deployed yet**.

Even though you created the environment manifest (`copilot/environments/dev/manifest.yml`), you must actually deploy it before deploying any services to it.

---

### ✅ Steps to fix

1. **Deploy the `dev` environment**:

```bash
copilot env deploy --name dev
```

* This will create the VPC, subnets, security groups, and all the networking resources defined in your `dev` manifest.

2. **Deploy the backend service**:

```bash
copilot svc deploy --name backend --env dev
```

3. **Verify environment variables**:

```bash
copilot svc show --name backend
```

You should now see:

```
AWS_S3_BUCKET   backend   dev   ts-audio-ilakkm-aug31
```

---

Once this is done, your `/health` check will correctly pick up the S3 bucket.

Do you want me to **give the full command sequence** from environment deploy → service deploy → health check so you can run it in one go?
