üëâ Do you want me to help you verify that your ECS Task Role has s3:ListBucket / s3:GetObject for this bucket? That‚Äôs the next most likely blocker.

Perfect üëç Let‚Äôs verify your ECS **Task Role** has the right S3 permissions. Here‚Äôs how we can do it step by step:

---

### 1. Identify your ECS Task Role

Run this command to see which IAM role your ECS task is using:

```bash
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition backend
```

Look for the field:

```json
"taskRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/<your-task-role>"
```

That‚Äôs the IAM role we need to check.

---

### 2. Check the role‚Äôs attached policies

Once you have the role name, run:

```bash
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name <your-task-role>
```

and

```bash
aws iam list-role-policies --role-name <your-task-role>
```

This will show **managed** and **inline** policies.

---

### 3. Verify S3 permissions

You need at least the following in one of the policies:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:ListBucket"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>"
},
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "s3:GetObject"
  ],
  "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<your-bucket-name>/*"
}
```

üîë Note:

* `ListBucket` must be on the **bucket ARN** (no `/*`).
* `GetObject` must be on the **object ARN** (with `/*`).

---

### 4. If missing, attach a new inline policy

Example command (replace bucket name + role name):

```bash
aws iam put-role-policy \
  --role-name <your-task-role> \
  --policy-name S3AccessPolicy \
  --policy-document '{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:ListBucket"],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name"
      },
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket-name/*"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

üëâ Do you want me to walk you through running **Step 1 (find the task role)** right now, and you can paste me the output? That way I can help craft the exact S3 policy for your bucket.
