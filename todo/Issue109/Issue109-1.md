Got it. Let’s go **step by step** to resolve your S3 `AccessDenied` issue from your ECS task. I’ll assume your service is trying to **read/write objects** in S3.

---

## **Step 1: Identify the ECS Task Role**

1. Go to **AWS ECS Console → Clusters → Your Cluster → Tasks → Your Task → Task Role ARN**.
2. Note the **IAM role name** attached to the ECS task.

---

## **Step 2: Check IAM Role Permissions**

1. Go to **AWS IAM Console → Roles → Your ECS Task Role**.
2. Check if it has a policy allowing S3 access. For example:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> ✅ `s3:GetObject` → needed for reading files
> ✅ `s3:PutObject` → needed for writing files
> ✅ `s3:ListBucket` → optional, needed if your app lists objects

3. If missing, **attach an inline policy** with the correct actions and bucket ARN.

---

## **Step 3: Verify the Bucket Name**

* Make sure your ECS service/environment variables or config file has the **exact S3 bucket name**.
* S3 is case-sensitive. Even a small typo will fail.

---

## **Step 4: Check Bucket Policy**

1. Go to **S3 Console → Your Bucket → Permissions → Bucket Policy**.
2. Ensure the policy **doesn’t explicitly deny** your ECS role. For example, a correct bucket policy for ECS tasks might be:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/YourECSRoleName"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

* **Avoid using `Deny` statements** that block the ECS role.

---

## **Step 5: Verify ECS Task Role Propagation**

* If you just updated the IAM role or policy, **stop and redeploy your ECS task**. ECS tasks only get **role permissions at launch**, so updates require a task restart.

```bash
aws ecs update-service --cluster your-cluster --service your-service --force-new-deployment
```

---

## **Step 6: Test Access from ECS Task**

* Exec into the ECS container:

```bash
aws ecs execute-command \
    --cluster your-cluster \
    --task <task-id> \
    --container <container-name> \
    --command "/bin/sh" \
    --interactive
```

* Try accessing S3:

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://your-bucket-name
aws s3 cp test.txt s3://your-bucket-name/test.txt
```

* If this works, permissions are fixed.

---

## **Step 7: Common Pitfalls**

1. **Using wrong account** – ensure the ECS task and S3 bucket are in the **same AWS account** or cross-account access is configured.
2. **Environment variable mismatch** – check the bucket name in `.env` or ECS service config.
3. **IAM propagation delay** – sometimes IAM role changes take **a few seconds to a minute** to propagate.

If you want, I can give you a **ready-to-use policy JSON** for your ECS task role that safely allows **read/write** to a specific bucket without leaving security holes.

Do you want me to do that?
