* **Public URL:**

```
https://fumiko-unalarmed-sprayfully.ngrok-free.dev
```

* **Local FastAPI URL:**

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

### **What this means**

1. Anyone with the **ngrok URL** can access your FastAPI backend.
2. You can open in browser:

```
https://fumiko-unalarmed-sprayfully.ngrok-free.dev/docs
```

* This shows the **Swagger UI** with your endpoints.
* Your `/speak` endpoint is now publicly reachable.

3. **Connect your frontend**

In your S3 frontend code, set the backend API URL to:

```javascript
https://fumiko-unalarmed-sprayfully.ngrok-free.dev
```

* Then when someone types text and clicks **Convert**, the frontend will call your FastAPI `/speak` endpoint via this ngrok URL.

---

âœ… Your TTS app is now **publicly testable**.

If you want, I can give a **quick test curl command** to make sure the public URL is working with `/speak` before updating your frontend.

Do you want me to do that?
