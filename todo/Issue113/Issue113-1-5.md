Yes! ✅ That’s exactly it.

Your frontend is now live at:

```
http://ilakkmanoharan5840-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

* Opening this URL in your browser will load your **S3-hosted frontend**.
* Your frontend will make API calls to whatever is set in your environment (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`) or `config.json` (if you used the dynamic config method).

---

⚠️ **Important:**

* Since this is an S3 static site, it serves over **HTTP**. If you want HTTPS, you’ll need to put **CloudFront in front of S3**.
* If your backend (ngrok) is HTTPS, modern browsers may block mixed content (HTTP frontend → HTTPS backend). Using CloudFront + HTTPS avoids this problem.

If you want, I can give you a **quick way to make this S3 frontend work with your ngrok backend safely** so you can test audio generation immediately.

Do you want me to do that?
