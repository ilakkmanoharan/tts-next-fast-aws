Ah — that looks like a **frontend hosted on S3**.

Here’s what you need to do to connect it to your FastAPI backend:

---

## 1️⃣ Check the frontend

* Open the link in your browser:
  [http://ilakkmanoharan5840-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com](http://ilakkmanoharan5840-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
* See if there’s a text box / button for “Text to Speech”.

---

## 2️⃣ Configure the backend URL

Your frontend must know where your FastAPI API is running. Currently:

* Your FastAPI backend is on `localhost:8000` → **only accessible on your machine**.

For the frontend to work publicly, your backend must be accessible via **public URL** (not localhost).

### Quick ways to do this:

1. **Ngrok (for demo/testing)**

   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

   * It gives you a public HTTPS URL like `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`
   * In your frontend code, set the API base URL to this ngrok URL.

2. **Deploy FastAPI to AWS** (production-ready)
   Options:

   * **EC2** → run Docker container, open port 80/443
   * **Elastic Beanstalk / ECS** → managed container deployment
   * **API Gateway + Lambda** → serverless approach

---

## 3️⃣ CORS

Since your frontend is on **S3 domain** and backend is somewhere else, FastAPI must allow cross-origin requests:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # or the frontend URL
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

Without this, the browser will block requests.

---

✅ Summary

* Your S3 frontend is ready to use.
* Your FastAPI backend must be **publicly reachable** and allow **CORS**.
* Then the frontend can send text to `/speak` and get MP3 audio.

If you want, I can give **step-by-step instructions** to make your current Docker FastAPI container publicly accessible **so this S3 frontend will work immediately**.

Do you want me to do that?
