Perfect! I see your code is already set up to use an environment variable:

```ts
fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL}/voices`)
```

and

```ts
fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL}/generate-audio`, ...)
```

This is **exactly what we want**. You just need to define `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` to point to your ngrok URL.

Here’s how to do it:

---

### **1. Create or edit a `.env.local` file in your frontend project root**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://fumiko-unalarmed-sprayfully.ngrok-free.dev
```

> **Important:** The variable name must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in Next.js to make it accessible in the frontend.

---

### **2. Restart your Next.js dev server**

If you’re running locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or

```bash
yarn dev
```

This ensures the new env variable is loaded.

---

### **3. Rebuild for production**

When deploying to S3, build your frontend with the env variable:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```

or

```bash
yarn build
yarn export
```

> This generates the static files (`out/` folder) for S3 deployment, with the ngrok URL baked in.

---

### ✅ **Now your frontend will call your backend at the ngrok URL**

Whenever you restart ngrok and get a new URL, just update `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in `.env.local` and rebuild the frontend.

---

If you want, I can show a **trick to make the S3 frontend dynamically use the latest ngrok URL without rebuilding every time**—very handy for testing.

Do you want me to show that?
