Perfect — let’s make your FastAPI backend **publicly accessible** so your S3 frontend can call it. We’ll do this step by step using **ngrok** (quickest for testing/demo). Later, you can move to AWS for production.

---

## **Step 1: Install ngrok**

On your Mac:

```bash
brew install ngrok/ngrok/ngrok
```

Check it’s installed:

```bash
ngrok version
```

---

## **Step 2: Start your FastAPI container**

Make sure your backend is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

* If `tts-backend` is not running, start it:

```bash
docker start -a tts-backend
```

or if you need to run it fresh:

```bash
docker run -d --name tts-backend -p 8000:8000 \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_KEY \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET \
  -e AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1 \
  -e BUCKET=YOUR_BUCKET \
  tts-backend:latest
```

Check health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Should return:

```json
{"status":"ok","dependencies":{"s3":"ok","polly":"ok"}}
```

---

## **Step 3: Run ngrok**

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

You will see output like:

```
Forwarding    https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:8000
```

* The **HTTPS URL** is your public link.
* Anyone on the internet can now reach your FastAPI backend using this URL.

---

## **Step 4: Update your frontend**

1. Go to your S3 frontend code (or environment variable where API URL is defined).
2. Replace the backend URL with the **ngrok URL**:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = "https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app";
```

3. Save and redeploy the frontend to S3 if needed.

Now your frontend can send requests to the backend and generate speech.

---

## **Step 5: Test**

* Open your S3 frontend:
  [http://ilakkmanoharan5840-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com](http://ilakkmanoharan5840-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com)
* Type some text, click **Convert** → it should fetch the MP3 from FastAPI and either play or download it.

---

✅ Done! You now have a **working, publicly accessible TTS app**.

---

If you want, I can also give **instructions to make this permanent** with AWS (so you don’t rely on ngrok, which resets every few hours).

Do you want me to do that next?
