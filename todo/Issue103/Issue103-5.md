Perfect — this confirms your **Copilot dev environment cluster** is running:

### Clusters Overview

| Cluster Name                               | Services | Tasks                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- | --------------------- |
| tts-next-fast-aws-dev-Cluster-4ncoTKBCBuq5 | 1        | 0 Pending / 1 Running |
| tts-backend-cluster                        | 1        | 0 Pending / 1 Running |

The cluster **`tts-next-fast-aws-dev-Cluster-4ncoTKBCBuq5`** is the one created by Copilot for your **dev environment**, and it currently has **1 running task** (your backend).

### Next Steps to Fix S3 403

1. **Identify the ECS task role**:

   * In the AWS console, go to **ECS → Clusters → tts-next-fast-aws-dev-Cluster-4ncoTKBCBuq5 → Services → backend → Tasks → Task Definition → Task Role**.
   * This role is what your backend uses to access AWS resources like S3.

2. **Check IAM permissions for S3**:

   * Go to **IAM → Roles → \[Task Role Name] → Permissions**.
   * Ensure it has a policy allowing:

     ```
     s3:HeadBucket
     s3:GetObject
     s3:PutObject
     ```

     for the S3 bucket your backend uses.

3. **Add policy if missing**:

   * Attach an inline policy or managed policy with the permissions above.

4. **Redeploy backend**:

```bash
copilot svc deploy --name backend --env dev
```

5. **Test /health endpoint** again:

```bash
curl -i http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
```

If you want, I can **write the exact IAM JSON policy for your Copilot ECS backend task** that will fix the 403 S3 error immediately — ready to attach.

Do you want me to do that?
