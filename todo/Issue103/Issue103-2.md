That `404 Not Found` is expected because `/api/your-endpoint` was just a **placeholder** I used as an example — your backend doesn’t have a route at that path.

Right now, the only endpoint you tested that exists (even if it fails) is `/health`, which triggers the **S3 dependency check**.

### Key takeaways:

1. Your backend is **reachable**, ELB is routing requests correctly. ✅
2. Any `404` just means that **no route exists** at that path — you need to call the **actual routes defined in your FastAPI app**.
3. The `/health` endpoint returns a `500` because the **task’s IAM role doesn’t have S3 permissions**.

---

### Next steps:

* **List the valid backend endpoints** in your FastAPI app (look for `@app.get`, `@app.post`, etc.).
* **Fix S3 permissions** for your ECS task so `/health` and other S3-dependent endpoints return `200 OK`.

If you want, I can write a **step-by-step guide to fix the S3 403 issue and get `/health` passing** for your deployed backend. Do you want me to do that?
