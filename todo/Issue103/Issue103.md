That response is actually a **good sign** — it means:

* Your backend is **up and reachable** via the ELB.
* The `404 Not Found` comes from your **FastAPI (or similar) app**, meaning the root path `/` doesn’t have a route defined.

### What to do next:

1. **Check the correct endpoint paths** your backend exposes.
   For example, if your backend has a health check at `/health` or `/api/status`, try:

```bash
curl -i http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
```

or

```bash
curl -i http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/api/your-endpoint
```

2. **Optional:** Add a root path route `/` in your FastAPI app to verify connectivity:

```python
@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"message": "Backend is running!"}
```

3. Once you hit a **valid endpoint**, you should see a `200 OK` with JSON data.

If you want, I can help you **list all valid endpoints of your backend** quickly so you know what to test. Do you want me to do that?
