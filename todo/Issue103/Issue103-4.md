Check the IAM role for your backend ECS task and ensure it has permissions for S3 (HeadBucket, GetObject, PutObject as needed).

Got it — let’s go step by step to **check and fix the IAM role for your backend ECS task** so it can access S3.

## **Step 1: Identify the ECS Task Role used by Copilot**

1. Copilot automatically creates a **task IAM role** for each service. To see it:

```bash
copilot svc show --name backend --app tts-next-fast-aws
```

Look for a line like:

```
Task Role ARN: arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole-<service>-<env>
```

> If it’s not displayed directly in `svc show`, you can find it in the AWS Management Console:
>
> * Go to **ECS → Clusters → dev → backend → Tasks → Task Definition → Task Role**

---

## **Step 2: Check the IAM policy attached**

1. Go to the **IAM console**: [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/)
2. Navigate to **Roles** → find your ECS task role.
3. Check **attached policies** — does it have **S3 permissions**?

You’ll need at minimum:

```json
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": [
        "s3:HeadBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
    ],
    "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    ]
}
```

---

## **Step 3: Attach or update policy**

1. If your task role doesn’t have S3 access, click **“Add inline policy”** or **attach a managed policy** with S3 permissions.
2. Paste the JSON above, replacing `your-bucket-name` with the bucket your backend uses.
3. Save the policy.

---

## **Step 4: Redeploy your service**

After updating the IAM role, redeploy the backend so the new permissions take effect:

```bash
copilot svc deploy --name backend --env dev
```

---

## **Step 5: Test**

```bash
curl -i http://tts-ne-Publi-j6NoWpqH34EH-112063658.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
```

If the IAM role is correct, you should now get:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{ "status": "ok", "dependency": "s3" }
```

---

If you want, I can **write the exact JSON policy snippet** for your ECS task role that will fix the 403 immediately, ready to paste into the IAM console.

Do you want me to do that?
