INFO:     Started server process [1]

Ah ‚Äî the logs show that **Uvicorn started successfully**, and there‚Äôs **no crash reported at startup**:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

This means the container is running and FastAPI is listening, but your `curl` is still failing. That usually points to one of these:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI is **not handling `/health`** properly

Double-check your `main.py`. A minimal working `/health` endpoint should look like:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/health")
def health():
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

If `/health` references something like S3, Polly, or a database without credentials or proper config, the request will **fail and reset the connection**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Docker networking

Since the container maps `0.0.0.0:8000->8000`, `curl http://localhost:8000/health` should work. But if your FastAPI app uses **async code or blocking code** incorrectly, the server may reset the connection.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Firewall / antivirus interference

On macOS, sometimes local firewall or VPN settings interfere with localhost port mapping, though this is less common.

---

### üîπ Quick test

Try connecting from **inside the container**:

```bash
docker exec -it tts-backend curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

* If this works, the problem is with Docker‚Äôs host networking.
* If it still fails, the `/health` endpoint likely raises an exception.

---

If you want, I can give you a **minimal `main.py` template with logging added to `/health` and all requests**, so you can immediately see why the connection resets. This usually fixes these silent failures.

Do you want me to do that?
