Great ‚Äî the container is actually **up** (`STATUS: Up 2 minutes`), which means it didn‚Äôt immediately crash. The `Recv failure: Connection reset by peer` suggests the FastAPI app **started but then reset the connection** when `/health` was called. This usually happens if:

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ FastAPI crashes internally on the first request

Check your logs inside the container:

```bash
docker logs tts-backend
```

Look for Python exceptions, missing imports, or AWS-related errors (S3, Polly, etc.), which often break the request handling.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `/health` endpoint itself has an error

If your `/health` endpoint references any services (like S3, Polly, database) without proper credentials or network access, it may raise an exception, closing the connection.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ File permissions / missing directories

You created `/var/log/tts-backend`, but if your app tries to write logs to a different path or lacks permission, it can crash when handling requests.

Check inside container:

```bash
docker exec -it tts-backend ls -l /var/log/tts-backend
docker exec -it tts-backend cat /var/log/tts-backend/error.log
```

---

### üîπ Immediate debugging steps

1. Tail logs in real time:

```bash
docker logs -f tts-backend
```

2. Try running uvicorn **manually inside the container** to see immediate errors:

```bash
docker exec -it tts-backend bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

This will show any Python traceback immediately when you hit `/health`.

---

If you want, I can **write a minimal debug command** that runs your container with full logging to `/var/log/tts-backend/error.log` and keeps stdout, so you can see exactly why `/health` fails.

Do you want me to do that?
