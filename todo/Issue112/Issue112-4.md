Perfect! âœ… Your FastAPI container can now successfully access **S3** and **Polly**.

This means:

* Your **AWS credentials** are correctly passed into the container.
* The **FastAPI `/health` endpoint** is now reading credentials at runtime.
* S3 bucket access and Polly service checks are working as expected.

Your backend is fully healthy and ready to handle requests.

If you want, we can now **enhance `/health` further** to also:

* Check a **specific S3 prefix** (like `_next/`)
* Optionally test **writing a small file** to S3 to ensure full read/write capability

This makes the health check fully production-ready.

Do you want me to do that next?
