Let’s go **step by step** to update your frontend to call your Copilot backend properly. I’ll assume you are using **Next.js** or a similar framework for your frontend.

---

## **Step 1: Get your backend ALB URL**

1. Run the Copilot command to see the deployed backend URL:

```bash
copilot svc show --name backend --env test
```

2. Look for the line **“URL”** or **“Load balancer endpoint”**, which should look something like:

```
http://backend-xxxxxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

> This is the URL your frontend needs to call.

---

## **Step 2: Update your frontend environment**

For a Next.js frontend, you usually use **environment variables**.

1. Open the `.env` file in your frontend project (create one if it doesn’t exist).
2. Add a variable for your backend API URL:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://backend-xxxxxxx.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

> Prefix `NEXT_PUBLIC_` so Next.js exposes it to the frontend code.

3. Make sure to **restart your frontend build** after updating the `.env` file:

```bash
# If using development server
npm run dev

# Or for static export
npm run build
npm run export
```

---

## **Step 3: Update API calls in your frontend code**

Anywhere your frontend calls the backend, replace the old URL with the environment variable:

```javascript
// Example using fetch
const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL}/api/data`, {
  method: 'GET',
});

const data = await response.json();
```

> Using `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` ensures your code is environment-agnostic. You can deploy to multiple environments (test/prod) without changing the code.

---

## **Step 4: Rebuild and sync the frontend to S3**

After updating the API calls:

```bash
# Build and export frontend
npm run build
npm run export

# Sync static files to S3
aws s3 sync out/ s3://ilakkmanoharan5840-frontend --delete
```

> Your frontend is now configured to call your backend ALB directly.

---

## **Step 5 (Optional but recommended): Test**

1. Open your S3 static website URL:

```
http://ilakkmanoharan5840-frontend.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

2. Interact with your frontend. If API calls work, you should see data from your backend.

---

✅ **Tips:**

* If you later add CloudFront, you may need to update CORS settings on your backend.
* Use **HTTPS** instead of HTTP in production. This can be done once you set up CloudFront with SSL.

You can **write the exact commands to set up CloudFront + SSL** so your frontend can call the backend securely over HTTPS.
